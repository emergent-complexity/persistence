# Persistence vAlpha: The Entropy Audit 🌀

> **"Life is a temporary defiance of the Second Law. This is the ledger of that defiance."**

**Persistence** is a high-fidelity Artificial Life (ALife) simulation engine built on the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Unlike traditional simulations that treat agents as abstract entities, Persistence treats life as a **dissipative structure**—a temporary pattern of matter that must constantly harvest energy and export entropy to survive.

## 🧬 The Three Pillars

### 1. The Thermodynamic Ledger (Scientific)
Every action has a cost. The simulation maintains a strict global accounting of mass and energy. 
* **Mass Conservation:** Matter is never created or destroyed; it is transformed from environmental fields into biomass, and eventually into necromass.
* **Entropy as Heat:** Metabolic processes generate thermal waste. Agents must manage their local environment's temperature or face thermal collapse.

### 2. Ecological Consciousness (Educational)
Persistence serves as a digital laboratory for studying systemic resilience.
* **Resource Management:** Witness how "greedy" genetic traits lead to localized resource depletion and systemic "Heat Death."
* **Cycle of Life:** Study the transition from raw resources to complex organisms and the vital role of decomposition.

### 3. Aesthetic Science (Creative)
The beauty of the simulation emerges from its constraints.
* **Telemetric Visuals:** A sci-fi inspired "Command Center" view that tracks the top causes of death and population stability in real-time.
* **Generative Patterns:** Watch isotropic diffusion and biological activity carve unique landscapes of heat and matter.

## 🛠 Project Structure
* `src/`: Core physics (`environment.py`), biology (`biology.py`), and the orchestrator (`engine.py`).
* `utils/`: Real-time telemetric rendering (`viz.py`) and data analysis.
* `config.py`: The universal constants and "Laws of Physics" for the simulation.
